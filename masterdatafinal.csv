1,end-to-end training of deep visuomotor policies,11,https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00702,Sergey Levine|Chelsea Finn|Trevor Darrell|Pieter Abbeel,"The first convincing application of deep learning in robotics control~This was the paper which first seriously popularized robotics as a problem of interest to the deep learning community. Many of the previous papers that applied deep learning techniques to robotics tasks looked at the perception problem in isolation. This paper hinted at the fact that the entire stack|from perception to actuation|could potentially be recast as a learning problem without suffering a catastrophic degradation in sample efficiency.~This paper clearly deserves to be on this list as it will likely be the most highly-cited robot learning paper of the decade. The paper started a conversation about the viability of end-to-end learning in robotics. I believe that this paper is interesting|not because of theoretical or algorithmic novelty as others on the list|but because it reads like a systems paper. From this work we learn that: (1) locally linear models combined with reasonable kinodynamic planning is ""close enough"" for a variety of manipulation and locomotion tasks|(2) the power of deep learning is not yet in replacing classical planning components but more to facilitate generalization across task instances|and (3) the connections between policy learning and probabilistic inference. More importantly it also illustrates several key limitations: (1) carefully constructed tasks and observability|(2) account for non-linearities due to contact conditions|and (3) the data collection/reset process.~This is an excellent example of reinforcement learning applied to closed-loop visual control for challenging robotics tasks and a good example of the application of deep-learning to real-world robotics.~For me the first paper that really showed the potential of deep learning for robot movements.~This paper was one of the first demonstrations of applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) and policy search to a real world robotics task. It demonstrated the feasibility of learning new tasks with a very limited number of trials|on a real robot. Most impressively|the policy was trained on directly on the camera data from the robot.~This work has drawn attention to end-to-end learning with neural networks|which I think was the beginning of the big boom of the deep learning in robotics.  ~The paper by Sergey Levine|Chelsea Finn et al shows how the perception and control system of a vision-based manipulation robot can be trained jointly with a trajectory-centric reinforcement learning approach (building on the guided-policy search framework).  In particular|this paper promotes the idea of ""end-to-end trainingâ€š"" in robot learning|as well as the use of deep neural networks. Both of these aspects have been very influential in the area and inspired many follow-up works. Overall|this paper (or the series of works around this one) significantly pushed the state-of-the-art in robot learning and constitutes one of the most powerful results and methods in modern RL.~This paper uses deep reinforcement learning to get a PR2 to pretty robustly hang a coat hanger on a clothes rack|insert a block into a shape sorting cube|fit the claw of a toy hammer under a nail|and screw on a bottle cap.  There were no prior demonstrations used|the resulting network takes in raw camera images and outputs robot motor torques directly|and each task took less than 300 learning trials to train.  Especially given how wobbly/inaccurate PR2 arms are|that is quite impressive.~It introduced end-to-end training with impressive results going from pixels to torques on several interesting tasks.~This work has shown a robot performing a variety of contact-rich manipulation tasks with learned controllers that close the loop around RGB images. This work spawned a flurry of research in reinforcement and representation learning.",2016,Journal of Machine Learning Research
2,pilco: a model-based and data-efficient approach to policy search,8,http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/pdf/DeiRas11.pdf,Marc Peter Deisenroth|Carl Edward Rasmussen,One of the first papers to really take uncertainty seriously in the RL + robotics space. Probably the first paper to convince me that model-based RL is worthwhile to think about|even in hard-to-model robotics domains.~it is a nice answer to the problem of learning models. ~Demonstrates a way to efficiency learn a task through model-based reinforcement learning.~The paper shows how data-efficient model-based RL control methods can actually get. PILCO is an idea that in different variations is still around.~In principle|model based RL offers many advantages for robot learning|such as efficient use of data and the ability to predict in advance how a trajectory will roll out. In practice|however|getting model based RL to work has proved to be very difficult. In this work|the authors tackle a key difficulty F112 when optimizing a policy for a dynamics model that was learned from data|model errors get exploited by the optimization algorithm. A very elegant solution is proposed: uncertainty estimation should be incorporated into the decision making process|thereby discouraging the optimization to visit states where model uncertainty is high and the predictions are likely to be wrong. This intuitive idea is implemented using Gaussian processes|which offer a principled approach to modeling uncertainty in continuous dynamical systems. The resulting algorithm - PILCO - is demonstrated to be very efficient in sample complexity|improving upon the state of the art  by orders of magnitude. This paper introduced several key ideas that have since been implemented in many subsequent works on robot learning and model based RL.~The paper by Marc Deisenroth and Carl Rasmussen promotes the use of Gaussian processes (GPs) for model-based reinforcement learning and proposes the PILCO algorithm|one of the most influential algorithms in recent reinforcement learning. GPs are by now heavily used in control and robotics communities. While this paper wasn't the first to use GPs in this context|it's arguably one of the most influential ones. Moreover|this work addresses the problem of data-efficiency in RL|which is of crucial importance for RL in the real world (such as in robotics). The PILCO algorithms has since been used in many different applications and extended in many ways. I consider the PILCO algorithm (or the underlying approach to model-based RL) as one of the state-of-the-art methods in modern RL.~This paper showed in an impressive way how to leverage modern probabilistic methods and model-based reinforcement learning to enable fast policy search. It  has become THE reference modeling and inference in nondeterministic tasks. The authors use analytical gradients for efficient policy updates|thereby eschewing the typical problems related to sampling methods. The result is an approach that can learn the cart-pole swing up on a real device in about 20 seconds. If you are doing anything related to reinforcement learning with probabilistic methods|this is a must-read. ~PILCO is an extremely data-efficient model-based approach for learning policies. At the core of the approach is the Gaussian process transition model. This nonparametric Bayesian representation allows the robot to capture its uncertainty of the state transitions and thus reason about a distribution of potential models given the robot's past experiences. This approach allows the robot to compute analytical gradients for updating its polices and results in highly data efficient learning. PILCO is a great example for highlighting the benefits of using model-based approaches and capturing uncertainty. PILCO has been used for a number of robotics projects over the years|including the control of a low-cost robotic arm for stacking blocks using visual feedback.,2011,International Conference of Machine Learning
3,dynamical movement primitives: learning attractor models for motor behaviors,6,https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~todorov/courses/amath579/reading/DynamicPrimitives.pdf,Auke Jan Ijspeert|Jun Nakanishi|Heiko Hoffmann|Peter Pastor|Stefan Schaal,DMPs proved to be a very useful representation for robot learning. The paper gives the clearest presentation ten years after they were invented~It provides a detailed explanation of derivation and usage of dynamic movement primitives|a learning by demonstration method that encodes motion with a set of weighted kernel function|which offers great means of further learning|modification etc.|and has been extensively applied in robotics.~Foundation for motion planning using iterative learning methods~The right parametrization is often the key in a learning system. Dynamical movement primitives (Ijspeert|Nakanishi|Schaal|2003) are a very successful way to encode movements in robots. The idea is to use dynamical systems with desired properties|such as stable attractors or rhythmic solutions|as building blocks. This provides a low-dimensional parametrization and combining them linearly  allows for effective learning.  So far it was mainly used for learning from demonstration.~Not the first paper on Dynamical movement primitives|but a great update on DMP.~Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) specify a way to model goal-directed behaviours as non-linear dynamical system with a learnable attractor behaviour. In this way|the movement trajectory can be of almost arbitrary complexity but remains well-behaved and stable. DMPs are interesting for robot learning as they provide a simple way to learn from demonstrations. The forcing term that shapes the movement trajectory is linear in a set of learnable weights. Any function approximator can be used to learn these parameters. Locally weighted regression has been of particular interest as it is a very easy one-shot learning procedure.,2013,Neural Computation (Volume 25|Issue 2)
4,a reduction of imitation learning and structured prediction to no-regret online learning,5,https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0686,Stephane Ross|Geoffrey J. Gordon|J. Andrew Bagnell,"Dagger points to a problem that keeps popping up in everyone's research. Every robot learning person should know about it.~This paper provides the first formal analysis of the (dynamic) covariate shift problem|where the suboptimal execution behavior of a policy drives the system to different states than those observed during training. While the general problem itself was well-known at the time (""Behavioral Cloning: A Correction"" Michie 1995; Alvinn: ""An autonomous land vehicle in a neural network"" Pomerleau 1989)|a disciplined analysis was lacking in the community. Ross et al. use a regret analysis to analyze and theoretically control the effects of dynamic covariate shift. The theory and algorithmic tools proposed in this work are still an active area of research today.~Imitation learning is a very appealing approach to learning robot skills. This paper shows that the straightforward technique of 'behavioral cloning' - simply copying the expert demonstrations|is actually not a good idea in sequential tasks. The reason is due to an effect of accumulating errors - once the learning agent strays away from states seen in the demonstration|it's learned policy is no longer accurate|causing it to stray even further away from the demonstration. There beauty of the paper is in capturing this idea mathematically|using no regret theoretical framework|and suggesting a simple algorithmic solution to the problem. The method|dubbed Dataset Aggregation (DAgger)|asks for additional expert actions *on states visited by the policy*.
The idea of controlling the distribution shift between the expert and the learner has since been fundamental to robotic imitation learning|and has manifested in various other methods.~This paper proposes 'Dagger'|an online learning algorithm for sequential decision making problems - a ubiquitous problem especially in robotics. It solves the problem that a policy trained on expert demonstrations may encounter new states that it has not seen in the training data. This will lead to error propagation and finally divergence of the policy. To bound this error|the authors propose to keep aggregating data when rolling out a learned policy and keep retraining the policy on this new data. ~Introduces Data Aggregation and the general approach of viewing policy optimization as online learning. Formalizes the notion of interaction with an expert as surrogate objective to the usual policy optimization objective.",2011,14th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics
5,alvinn: an autonomous land vehicle in a neural network,4,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/95-alvinn-an-autonomous-land-vehicle-in-a-neural-network.pdf,Dean A. Pomerleau,"On the theoretical side|the first paper to recognize covariate shift in imitation learning and provide a simple data-augmentation style strategy to improve it. On the implementation side|a real self-driving first that led to ""No Hands Across America"".~This work presents the first successful application of imitation learning to an autonomous system. I think this is a pivotal work in the early years of robot learning. ~This work was pioneering with respect to machine learning in robotics broadly|learning from demonstration specifically|and also autonomous driving. It applied a neural net to learn steering angles from examples of human driving (even online!)|way back in 1989. By today's deep learning standards the net was tiny (5 hidden units) and the sensor input extremely limited (30x32 image pixels)|but it worked... and at a time when robots rarely operated outside of the lab or factory|and machine learning was rarely deployed on real hardware. It is the first* example of using demonstration-based learning for high-stakes control|that required (comparatively) fast sampling (25Hz) and operated a large van at regular road speeds (20mph). The vehicle was a part of NavLab|which was the precursor to CMU's DARPA Grand and Urban Challenges entires in the early 2000's|and those challenges in turn played a big role in accelerating today's driverless car boom.

Ng,"This paper demonstrated to many in the ML community the then under-appreciated fact that reinforcement learning could be a viable framework to address very complex control tasks.~The helicopter stunts achieved in this work are some of the most compelling examples in robotics of both imitation learning and reinforcement learning.  (The combination of the two is called apprenticeship learning.)  In this work|multiple|imperfect trajectory demonstrations are used to generate ideal trajectories|and then reinforcement learning is used to learn sequences of linear feedback controllers that reproduce those trajectories.  When people say things like ""but there haven't really been many successes in using reinforcement learning on *real* robots|right?"" you can point to this work and say|""sure there are!  Have you *seen* these crazy helicopter tricks?""~Still one of the coolest demos of robot learning.~This paper presents a beautiful and compelling demonstration of the strength of learning dynamical models and using optimal control to learn complex tasks on intrinsically unstable systems even if the learned models rather crude and the optimal controllers are based on linearization|both strong approximations of reality.

Ng,A key paper in grasp learning. The approach is relatively simple in nature (hack to get grasp orientation|simple features as anchors)|but it was at the time a very clear example of an approach that starkly contrasted with mainstream grasping.~This is one of the first works in literature that utilized machine learning for the robotic manipulation problem. The proposed framework is still useful to design similar robot learning solutions. The particular importance of this work is to identify local features that are related to manipulation planning~This paper lead a generation of PhD students to reimagine how grasping|and manipulation more generally|could be approached as a machine learning problem. Treating the grasp learning problem as a supervised learning problem without explicit human demonstrations or reinforcement learning|Saxena and colleagues' work stood as an example of how manipulation could be approached from a perceptual angle. A decade before deep learning made a splash in robotics|this work showed how robots could be trained to manipulate previously unseen objects without a need for complete 3D or dynamics models. While the learning techniques and features may have changed|the general formulation still stands as the initial approach many researchers take when implementing a grasp planning algorithm.~One of the first papers using general visual features for grasping,2008,International Journal of Robotics Research
8,from skills to symbols: learning symbolic representations for abstract high-level planning,3,http://irl.cs.brown.edu/pubs/orig_sym_jair.pdf,George Konidaris|Leslie Pack Kaelbling|Tomas Lozano-Perez,"As we get better at low-level robotic control|the community will need to start thinking more about longer-horizon problems and how to smoothly flow between reasoning at different levels of abstraction.  This paper presents a theoretically-ground formal treatment of the problem|proves some nice stuff about what constitutes necessary and sufficient symbols for various types of planning|and shows some nice demos on a real robot.  It is by far the best analysis of hierarchical learning / planning that I know of and provides a much-needed theoretical foundation for moving this area of research forward.~There exists a representational gap between the continuous sensorimotor world of a robot and the discrete symbols used by advanced AI planning methods. Many existing studies typically assume the existence of precoded planning symbols|and investigate how to learn the relations between these pre-coded symbols and continuous world of the robot. Few others argue that symbols should be formed in relation to the experience of agents through their sensorimotor experience.  This paper presents a structured approach|which is built on Markov-decision process formalism|to discover symbolic abstract representations from low-level high-dimensional continuous sensorimotor experience. The learned symbols and rules can automatically and effectively expressed in PDDL|a canonical high-level planning domain language|enabling high-level planning with traditional off-the-shelf AI planners.~Abstraction is an important aspect of robot learning. This paper addresses the issue of learning state abstractions for efficient high-level planning. Importantly|the state abstraction should be induced from the set of skills/options that the robot is capable of executing. The resulting abstraction can then be used to determine if any plan is feasible. The paper addresses both deterministic and probabilistic planning. It is also a great example of learning the preconditions and effects of skills for planning complex tasks.

This is a prominent example of the work of the Developmental Robotics community that ties link between developmental psychology|neurosciences and concrete robotics implementation and shows that exploring with this approach to learn to predict action consequences (forward models) results in behavior that is organized and shows similarity with human behavior.~This article describes some of the first successful experiments about ""curious robots"" and intrinsic motivation. It is one of the foundational articles in the ""developmental robotics"" field and inspired hundreds of papers about intrinsic motivation in reinforcement learning.~This work contributes to the general question of obtaining life-long learning robotic systems. Large body of the existing robot learning literature mostly focus on methods that enable the robots to learn particular pre-defined skills and achieve particular tasks. Life-long learning|on the other hand|requires the robots to learn skills and adapt to situations that were not (and cannot be) foreseen.  Inspired from human development|intrinsic motivation is an important drive that guides the robots towards regions that can be most effectively and efficiently learned with the capabilities developed so far; exploiting metrics such as novelty|curiosity|diversity|etc. This paper|in particular|is a seminal study that exploits maximization of learning progress in a real robot that explores its continuous sensorimotor space.

The authors show that both are useful--the latter for demonstrating goal-oriented skills|and the former for demonstrating means-oriented skills--and also discuss an intuitive hybrid interface that allows users to use both types in a single demonstration.  Simple yet practical methods like this for teaching robot skills are often ignored in academic papers.,2012,ACM/IEEE international conference on Human-Robot Interaction

130,assessing grasp stability based on learning and haptic data,1,https://www.it.lut.fi/mvpr/data/Bekiroglu-TRO2011.pdf,Yasemin Bekiroglu|Janne Laaksonen|Jimmy Alison Jurgensen|Ville Kyrki and Danica Kragic,"""Learning to grasp"" can actually imply a lot of different learning problems. We often think about grasp synthesis|i.e.|the problem of determining where to place the hand to achieve a stable grasp (I strongly recommend reading Data-Driven Grasp Synthesis- a Survey for more on this topic). This paper focuses on the important problem of using multiple sensor modalities to determine if an executed grasp attempt resulted in a stable grasp. As robot learning researchers|it is important to consider how problems can be approached from different directions and how different information sources can be incorporated and change the problem. One should also think about robustness and consider how learning factors into monitoring skill executions for errors.

131,grounding semantic categories in behavioral interactions: experiments with 100 objects,1,https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~jsinapov/papers/Sinapov_RAS2014.pdf,Jivko Sinapov|Connor Schenck|Kerrick Staley|Vladimir Sukhoy|Alexander Stoytchev,"Interactive perception and multimodal sensing are fundamental aspects of robotics and robot learning. The ability to execute actions to interact with the environment provides robots with a rich source of information|especially when combined with haptic|vision|and audio feedback. Grounding the object representations in the robot's actions provides the robot with representations that are not only well suited for future manipulation tasks|but that the robot can estimate through autonomous experimentation. The paper also touches on actively selecting actions to quickly reduce uncertainty.

robots)|and also as the means for initializing robot controllers (most 
prominently by Schaal and later Peters) to a reasonable policy that is 
later refined by learning. Schaal's work on this was probably more 
influential but it was preceded|and possibly inspired by|Gillian Hayes.

That combination was a major advance and accounts for almost all notable successful instances of robot motor skill learning until deep nets. All existing robot policy learning algorithms - including the latest|most fashionable deep approaches - are technically descended from this algorithm|and many researchers were inspired by its immense success.,2008,European Conference on Machine Learning

Rizzi|and Daniel E.

If safety guarantees are maintained for each of the local controllers|then this property can also hold for their composition.

This shows it is possible to build a hierarchy of representations|leading to agents that can build simple maps with behaviours such as wall-following controllers.
