This paper surveys locally weighted learning, a form of lazy
learning, and focuses on locally weighted linear regression.
The survey discusses
distance functions,
smoothing parameters, 
weighting functions, 
local model structures,
regularization of the estimates and bias, 
assessing predictions, 
handling noisy data and outliers,
improving the quality
of predictions by tuning fit parameters,
interference between old and new data,
implementing locally weighted learning efficiently, and
applications of locally weighted learning.
A companion paper surveys how locally
weighted learning can be used in robot learning and control.

Keywords: locally weighted regression,
LOESS, lazy learning, least commitment learning, distance functions,
smoothing parameters, weighting functions, global tuning, local tuning,
interference.
